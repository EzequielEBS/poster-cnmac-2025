 abstract = {We propose a general class of prior distributions for arbitrary regression models. We discuss parametric and semiparametric models. The prior specification for the regression coefficients focuses on observable quantities in that the elicitation is based on the availability of historical data D0 and a scalar quantity a0 quantifying the uncertainty in D0. Then D0 and a0 are used to specify a prior for the regression coefficients in a semiautomatic fashion. The most natural specification of D0 arises when the raw data from a similar previous study are available. The availability of historical data is quite common in clinical trials, carcinogenicity studies, and environmental studies, where large data bases are available from similar previous studies. Although the methodology we present here is quite general, we will focus only on using historical data from similar previous studies to construct the prior distributions. The prior distributions are based on the idea of raising the likelihood function of the historical data to the power a0, where ≤ a0 ≤ 1. We call such prior distributions power prior distributions. We examine the power prior for four commonly used classes of regression models. These include generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models, semiparametric proportional hazards models, and cure rate models for survival data. For these classes of models, we discuss the construction of the power prior, prior elicitation issues, propriety conditions, model selection, and several other properties. For each class of models, we present real data sets to demonstrate the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Abstract The power prior by Ibrahim and Chen (Statist. Sci. 2000; 15:46–60) is one of several methods to incorporate historical data in the analysis of a clinical trial. The power prior raises the likelihood of the historical data to the power parameter a0 which quantifies the discounting of the historical data due to heterogeneity between trials. It is shown that the standard method of estimating the power parameter from the historical and current data is inappropriate, and we therefore suggest to use a modified power prior approach or to consider alternative methods instead.

abstract = {The power prior has been widely used in many applications covering a large number of disciplines. The power prior is intended to be an informative prior constructed from historical data. It has been used in clinical trials, genetics, health care, psychology, environmental health, engineering, economics, and business. It has also been applied for a wide variety of models and settings, both in the experimental design and analysis contexts. In this review article, we give an A-to-Z exposition of the power prior and its applications to date. We review its theoretical properties, variations in its formulation, statistical contexts for which it has been used, applications, and its advantages over other informative priors. We review models for which it has been used, including generalized linear models, survival models, and random effects models. Statistical areas where the power prior has been used include model selection, experimental design, hierarchical modeling, and conjugate priors. Frequentist properties of power priors in posterior inference are established, and a simulation study is conducted to further examine the empirical performance of the posterior estimates with power priors. Real data analyses are given illustrating the power prior as well as the use of the power prior in the Bayesian design of clinical trials. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Visualization is helpful in each of these stages of the Bayesian workflow and it is indispensable when drawing inferences from the types of modern, high dimensional models that are used by applied researchers.},

abstract = {The power prior is a popular tool for constructing informative prior distributions based on historical data. The method consists of raising the likelihood to a discounting factor in order to control the amount of information borrowed from the historical data. However, one often wishes to assign this discounting factor a prior distribution and estimate it jointly with the parameters, which in turn necessitates the computation of a normalizing constant. In this article, we are concerned with how to approximately sample from joint posterior of the parameters and the discounting factor. We first show a few important properties of the normalizing constant and then use these results to motivate a bisection-type algorithm for computing it on a fixed budget of evaluations. We give a large array of illustrations and discuss cases where the normalizing constant is known in closed-form and where it is not. We show that the proposed method produces approximate posteriors that are very close to the exact distributions and also produces posteriors that cover the data-generating parameters with higher probability in the intractable case. Our results suggest that the proposed method is an accurate and easy to implement technique to include this normalization, being applicable to a large class of models. They also reinforce the notion that proper inclusion of the normalizing constant is crucial to the drawing of correct inferences and appropriate quantification of uncertainty.},

    abstract = {We present a definition for the effective sample size of a parametric prior distribution in a Bayesian model, and propose methods for computing the effective sample size in a variety of settings. Our approach first constructs a prior chosen to be vague in a suitable sense, and updates this prior to obtain a sequence of posteriors corresponding to each of a range of sample sizes. We then compute a distance between each posterior and the parametric prior, defined in terms of the curvature of the logarithm of each distribution, and the posterior minimizing the distance defines the effective sample size of the prior. For cases where the distance cannot be computed analytically, we provide a numerical approximation based on Monte Carlo simulation. We provide general guidelines for application, illustrate the method in several standard cases where the answer seems obvious, and then apply it to some nonstandard settings.},
